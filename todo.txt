[ ] Add a "lossy compressed" header to avoid double compressing the image
[ ] Figure out what's making the lossy compression algo so slow VIA timing
[ ] Switch from Vec<Rgba> to &[u8] in Image for integration with other libraries
[ ] Implement commandline arguments
[ ] Add an option to use different types of lossy compression, such as "Bilinear Interpolation" or the "Closest Color" one that I have now.
